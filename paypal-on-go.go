The selected text is from a blog post discussing how PayPal managed to scale to billions of daily transactions using just eight virtual machines.
 Here are the key points:

- The author was intrigued by a Reddit post about PayPal's impressive scaling and decided to 
investigate further.

- The blog post shares the findings and also includes some Go code to provide a hands-on 
understanding of the
 technology behind this achievement.
- PayPal, created by a team of engineers in 1998, experienced a surge in popularity and a
 substantial increase 
in traffic during its early days.
- To cope with the demand, they invested in newer hardware to scale. However, the rapid 
growth led to a 
milestone of 1 million transactions a day within two years.
- To keep up with this growth, they expanded their infrastructure to more than 1000 virtual
 machines.
 While this addressed their scalability challenges
, it also introduced new complexities and issues related to managing a larger and more 
intricate system. 
The blog post goes on to discuss these challenges.
