Key learning points for zone01 by Edu01, remembering that Ai will be able to make itself in the future as well as make software products. The key to staying competitive is mastering theory especially in ux, machine learning and mathematics so as to architect with Ai as opposed to trying to compete with it.
Should find yourself attmpting to compete with AI, here are some facts for you to check yourself.

The memory capacity of the human brain is estimated to be around **2.5 petabytes**¹²³⁴. To put that in perspective, a petabyte is 1024 terabytes or a million gigabytes². So, the average adult human brain can accumulate the equivalent of 2.5 million gigabytes of memory². This is a massive amount of storage. If your brain worked like a DVR, you would have to leave the television running for over 300 years continuously to fill up 2.5 million petabytes³.

The memory capacity of AI systems is not fixed and can vary greatly depending on the specific system and its configuration¹². 

AI and Machine Learning (ML) applications are driving the need for better memory performance, capacity, and power efficiency¹. According to OpenAI, AI/ML training capability has increased by a factor of 300,000 between 2012 and 2019¹. AI/ML models and training sets are growing in size as well, with the largest models now exceeding 170 billion parameters and even larger models on the horizon¹.

However, the memory requirements to train AI models are typically several times larger than the number of parameters. This is because training requires storing intermediate activations, and this typically adds 3–4x more memory than the number of parameters².

It's important to note that the memory capacity of AI systems is not just about the amount of storage. The speed and efficiency of memory access, the architecture of the memory system, and the ability to handle large volumes of data are all crucial aspects of AI memory capacity¹².

In conclusion, while human memory has a rough estimate of capacity, AI memory capacity can be scaled up or down depending on the requirements of the specific task or application.

But there is hope!

While AI has made significant advancements, there are several limitations that make humans irreplaceable:

1. **Data Dependence**: AI systems are only as effective as the quality of data provided to them¹. They require large amounts of data to learn and make accurate predictions¹. However, not all data is useful or relevant, and determining the right data parameters can be challenging¹.

2. **Lack of Common Sense**: AI systems lack the ability to apply common sense reasoning to problems⁵. They struggle with tasks that humans find intuitive, such as understanding context or making decisions based on limited information⁵.

3. **Algorithmic Bias**: AI systems can exhibit bias, reflecting the biases present in their training data¹. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes⁴.

4. **Lack of Creativity and Emotion**: AI systems lack the ability to truly understand and replicate human emotions⁵. They also struggle with tasks that require creativity⁵, a trait that is inherently human.

5. **Black Box Problem**: AI systems, particularly those based on deep learning, are often seen as "black boxes" because their operations are not easily understood or interpreted³. This lack of transparency can be a significant issue, especially in fields where explainability is crucial².

6. **Security and Ethical Concerns**: AI systems can be vulnerable to hacking and pose privacy concerns⁴. There are also ethical considerations related to job displacement and the use of AI in sensitive applications⁴.

In conclusion, while AI can augment human capabilities in many ways, it cannot replace the unique qualities that make us human. The creativity, intuition, emotional understanding, and ethical considerations that humans bring to tasks are irreplaceable and continue to be areas where AI falls short.
