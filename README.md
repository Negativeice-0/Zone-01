# Zone-01
Key learning points for zone01 by Edu01, remembering that Ai will be able to make itself in the future as well as make software products. The key to staying competitive is mastering theory especially in ux, machine learning and mathematics so as to architect with Ai as opposed to trying to compete with it.
Should find yourself attmpting to compete with AI, here are some facts for you to check yourself.

The memory capacity of the human brain is estimated to be around **2.5 petabytes**¹²³⁴. To put that in perspective, a petabyte is 1024 terabytes or a million gigabytes². So, the average adult human brain can accumulate the equivalent of 2.5 million gigabytes of memory². This is a massive amount of storage. If your brain worked like a DVR, you would have to leave the television running for over 300 years continuously to fill up 2.5 million petabytes³.

The memory capacity of AI systems is not fixed and can vary greatly depending on the specific system and its configuration¹². 

AI and Machine Learning (ML) applications are driving the need for better memory performance, capacity, and power efficiency¹. According to OpenAI, AI/ML training capability has increased by a factor of 300,000 between 2012 and 2019¹. AI/ML models and training sets are growing in size as well, with the largest models now exceeding 170 billion parameters and even larger models on the horizon¹.

However, the memory requirements to train AI models are typically several times larger than the number of parameters. This is because training requires storing intermediate activations, and this typically adds 3–4x more memory than the number of parameters².

It's important to note that the memory capacity of AI systems is not just about the amount of storage. The speed and efficiency of memory access, the architecture of the memory system, and the ability to handle large volumes of data are all crucial aspects of AI memory capacity¹².

In conclusion, while human memory has a rough estimate of capacity, AI memory capacity can be scaled up or down depending on the requirements of the specific task or application.
